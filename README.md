# BrandLink – Frontend Architecture & MVP Case Study

Frontend Development of the BrandLink MVP  
Internship Project at V.I.C Tech  
---
## Overview
BrandLink is a multi-role e-commerce and digital services platform designed to support Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in their digital transformation journey.
During my internship at V.I.C Tech, I led the frontend development of the platform’s Minimum Viable Product (MVP), implementing a scalable, role-based React architecture that supports Clients, Sellers, and Administrators.
The system integrates secure authentication flows, analytics dashboards, e-commerce workflows, and service management interfaces.

## Project Context
MSMEs in Morocco face:
- Limited digital visibility  
- Lack of secure and localized e-commerce tools  
- Minimal access to performance analytics
  
BrandLink was designed as an integrated solution combining:
- Secure e-commerce
- Role-based dashboards
- Analytics visualization
- Service marketplace integration
---
## My Responsibilities
As a Frontend Developer, I was responsible for:
- Designing and implementing the full React-based UI
- Translating Figma prototypes into responsive components
- Implementing role-based access control
- Managing state using React Context API
- Developing interactive dashboards using Recharts
- Integrating mapping visualization via React-Leaflet
- Implementing authentication and protected routing
- Coordinating frontend-backend integration
---
## System Architecture (Frontend Perspective)
The frontend was structured as a modular, component-based React application:
### Core Layers
1. Presentation Layer
   - Reusable UI components
   - Responsive layout
   - Role-specific dashboards
2. State Management Layer
   - React Context API
   - Persistent authentication via localStorage
   - Cart and product state synchronization
3. Routing & Access Control
   - Protected routes using RequireAuth
   - Role-based navigation guards
4. Data Visualization Layer
   - Recharts (Line, Pie, Bar charts)
   - React-Leaflet interactive maps
---
## Multi-Role Platform Design
The platform supports three primary roles:
### Client
- Product browsing
- Cart management
- Checkout and multi-payment options
- Profile management
- Freelance service discovery
### Seller
- Onboarding application
- Role-specific dashboards (Merchant, Payment, Delivery)
- Performance tracking
- Support request interface
### Administrator
- Product management
- Seller verification
- Job management
- Analytics overview dashboard
